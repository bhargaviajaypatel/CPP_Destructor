# CPP_Destructor
Destructor are another type of member function that is responsible for destroying or deleting the object.
It frees up space occupied by the object after it is no longer needed.
A destructor is called automatically when the object is out of scope and no longer needed.
A destructor has the name same as the class, but the only difference is that the name is preceded by a tile (~).
There has to be only one destructor in a class.
